\section{Problem statement}

KNX is an open communications protocol for Building Automation (BA).
It uses a layered structure and supports wired communication over twisted pair
and power line as well as wireless communication by radio transmission. 
Additionally, it supports communication with TCP/IP hosts by special gateways. 
As such, it can be used for controlling traditional services like Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), but also for more
sophisticated applications 
like surveillance or fire alarm systems of buildings \cite{knxapps}.
\\
Given these potential applications, a wide range of attacks would be possible. For example, Denial of Service (DOS) attacks to disable all directly connected
KNX devices can be conducted by simply physically shortcutting a line
connection, rendering the corresponding network segment unavailable.
Replay attacks by intercepting and replaying datagrams are also possible, allowing an adversary to introduce arbitrary KNX traffic, switching doors
or disabling burglar alarms. Passive attackers can monitor the bus traffic to analyze the types of KNX devices within the network, gathering knowledge that can be used
to develop further attack strategies.

%Such attacks can be conducted by passive advisories by replay attacks or eavesdropping, interception, altering and injecting of arbitrary telegrams.
Availability, in general, can only be achieved by redundancy, i.e. by using replicated resources. Therefore, all
resources needed for transmitting data between two points must exist redundantly and independently from 
each other.

The countermeasure against eavesdropping and replay attacks, providing integrity, confidentiality and authenticity, consists of authentication
between the sender and receiver of a message, and encryption of these messages, combined in a security scheme
called Authenticated Encryption (AE).
%To gain confidentiality, block or stream ciphers are used to garble the cleartext message into a block respectively stream
%of pseudo-random binary zeros and ones. Without possessing the key, the encryption must not
%be reversible in feasible time to protect the secret message from unauthorized entities.
%Integrity, on the other side, is achieved by taking blocks of input data and producing a short (compared
%to the data itself, which can consist of an arbitrarily large number of blocks) Message Authentication Code (MAC)
%for this data, which will be sent along with the data. The MAC function is some kind
%of one-way-function and must be 'difficult' to reverse, i.e. find parts or the whole block 
%which was feed to the function to obtain the given MAC.
%This way, altering of the sent data can be
%detected and the corresponding datagram can be discarded. Analog to encryption,
%it must be infeasible to find other MACs for the same message.  
\\

The basic KNX Standard is regarded as insufficient because the standard simply doesn't provide any encryption, authentication 
or availability mechanisms \cite{knxSpec}. To address the cryptographic issues, extensions are available, but no solution is disposable for 
improved availability with integrated security mechanisms.

%This work's overall topic is to propose a solution for KNX networks with a higher level of availability, compared to standard KNX networks.
%To allow the deployment in safety critical environments, cryptographic measurements to provide confidentiality and integrity will be integrated as well.

\section{Expected results}

The overall goal of this work is to develop a concept for a secure and high-available KNX network that also considers interoperability and compatibility, 
allowing the usage in environments with increased safety-critical requirements. 
To achieve this, so called security gateways will be used. These gateways will possess two kinds of KNX interfaces: one kind of interface will be
connected to standard, unsecured KNX networks.
The second interface constitutes the entry point to a secured KNX network which is connected to the secure interfaces of other
security gateways. To achieve higher availability, these secure interfaces and the respective communication lines must exist redundantly. This ensures that
even in case of a DOS attack, communication within the segment is possible.

To show the feasibility of the solution by a proof of concept, a demonstration network  shall be built.
For the security gateways, RaspberryPis in combination with KNX-USB-dongles will be used. Therefore, the RasperryPis
are acting as gateways between the secure and the insecure KNX networks, each of them running a master daemon responsible
for reading datagrams from the KNX insecure world, encrypting and authenticating them and sending them over the secure
KNX lines.

%\\
%It will be shown that booth concepts must go hand in hand to achieve confidentiality. 
%Consequently, the security layer will use strong encryption \textit{and} authentication to guard
%against attacks.
%\\

%To gain availability, a handshake protocol will be used, as well as some kind of 'heartbeat' mechanism to
%detect outages of one communication line as soon as possible, allowing to switch to the replicated line 
%instantaneously

%For gaining availability, it would be possible to define some kind of 'heartbeat' protocol which checks the status
%of the 2 lines, and switches the line in case of a failure. A disadvantage of this approach is that a considerable
%amount of bus load is generated. Alternatively, it is possible to just copy every KNX message to booth lines
%(after encrypting it), and use some kind of counter to remove duplicates on the receiving side. This solution
%needs no additional traffic, and is also 'faster' because no fail over recognition time is needed. 

%While it would be possible to encrypt and authenticate only the actual payloads, and leave the status
%datagrams unencrypted, a cleaner and more elegant solution is to encrypt and authenticate booth message 
%types. This makes it possible to use the concept of \textit{divide et impera} in an uncompromising way.
%Additionally, attacks against the heartbeat - mechanism become impossible.

It is important to note that the practical part of this work will only
handle the twisted-pair media of KNX (i.e. KNX TP-1), although the basic principles can be deployed in a modified manner in
wireless and power-line networks as well.

A threat analysis will be conducted to prove that the system can withstand the defined attacks and is robust,
i.e. that it can recover from erroneous states. This will be done by exposing the demonstration network to the various defined attacks.  

\section{Methodological approach}

Every secure system will just work within some defined barriers - it is impossible to build a system that
is secure under all circumstances. So, the very first step will be to define a realistic
threat scenario by studying typical attacks against Building Automation Systems (BAS) \cite{granzer2006security}.
Ensuring security in a network is a complex and comprehensive topic. Fortunately, canonical ways how to employ authenticated
encryption exist. 
Therefore, the next step is to research state-of-the-art techniques in order to decide which ciphers should be used. After that, the key exchange mechanism
must be defined, as well as the message format used. 

Also, a reasonable concept has to be found how
to guarantee high availability, considering the limited resources of standard KNX devices and the limited bandwidth of KNX TP-1.

Following the design paradigm of "divide et impera", security and availability related tasks will be implemented by two distinct layers. This design 
allows the modification of one layer without the need to modify the other layer.

%To implement the real-world testing environment, a master daemon will be written, consisting of a stack composed of EIBD (a C++ daemon for communication
%with different KNX backends through an API), the security / key exchange layer in combination with a cryptographic library and the availability layer. The master daemon will be written
%in C, and a GNU/Linux based operating system named Raspbian will be used for the RaspberryPis. 

After implementation, it is evaluated whether the demonstration network withstands the defined attacks,
and whether the protocol works in practice.

\section{State of the art}

%While these 2 approaches try to bring confidentiality to KNX, this work will also add availability to KNX, as stated 
%above. Additionally, this work will not rely on key servers, thus eliminating the need for a single 'point of trust'.
%Last but not least, the work of Salvatore Cavalieri and Giovanni Cutuli contains a serious design flaw by delegating 
%the task of key generation to a so called 'controller' with a fixed KNX address, which will be used to negotiate a key,
%thus using the KNX address as authentication property. If it is possible to deploy a malicious knx device into the network
%which responds 'faster' than the controller, the whole architecture is rendered useless. \cite{knxsecExt} by these authors
%addresses this shortcoming, but again, just makes theoretical assumptions.

The rapid growth of electronic data processing and digital communication enforces the need for secure and available systems.
Information security, consisting of the triad confidentiality, integrity and availability, tries to achieve such systems. 
Cryptography uses ciphers to achieve integrity and confidentiality and is also a prerequisite for availability. To improve the latter one,
replication is used. A replicated service uses redundant components, providing multiple outcomes. A voter mechanism is used to determine
which outcome is used.

Modern cryptography, emerged from primitive ciphers over thousands of years, is nowadays a well-studied topic. Basic properties of all cryptographic systems
are the data format, the kind of keys used, the mode of operation and the maximum lifetime of the keys: 

cryptographic data can be processed in the form of blocks or in the form of continuous
data streams. Stream ciphers can be provable "perfect secret" in principle
and can be implemented as simple as bitwise xor'ing the key and the data (i.e., the one-time pad). 

Block ciphers come in 2 flavors: Pseudo Random Functions (PRF), and Pseudo Random Permutations (PRP). While the latter one is reversible,
this is not true for the first one. Therefor, PRFs are only used in constructions which do not depend on a reverse function, for
example "Feistel Networks". A widely used encryption standard is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), derived from a block cipher
called "Rijndel".
This construction is reversible (i.e. is a PRP) and is also called a "substitution-permutation-network", named after it's 2 basic building blocks.
 
 Two kinds of keys are distinguished: until the introduction of public key cryptography, all ciphers were symmetric ciphers.
 Well known examples
 of asymmetric or public key ciphers are "RSA" \cite{Rivest:1978:MOD:359340.359342} and Diffie-Helmann (DH) \cite{1055638}. 
 While DH was originally based on exponentiation,
 a new method based on elliptic curves has been found which can achieve the same level of security with shorter keys.
 Prominent protocols like TLS \cite{rfc2246} use a mixture of symmetric and asymmetric ciphers.
 
 %The key exchange algorithm defines how the keys get distributed to all devices which are part of the secure network.
 %It would be possible to fix a key, place this key on all devices and use this Pre Shared Key (PSK) for symmetric
 %encryption, but this key cannot be changed at a later point without direct interaction on all devices. A better way is to use some
 %kind of asymmetric key which is used to establish session keys, which can be used in a symmetric manner.
 
 The mode of operation defines how large messages of arbitrary size are processed.
 Modes for encryption and authentication exist, some modes can also be used for booth tasks (i.e. cipher block chaining, CBC). Additionally, this property 
 decides the order of authenticating and encrypting the data. Depending on this ordering and
 what modes are used for authentication and encryption, attacks like padding oracles may be possible \cite{Vaudenay02securityflaws}. Correct ordering
 mitigates such attacks \cite{cryptoeprint} and leads to a combined security scheme called Authenticated Encryption (AE) \cite{ocb}.
 
Open source, high-level APIs like OpenSSL or Crypto++ offer a wide range of authentication, encryption and key exchange modes.
These libraries are widely used and actively maintained, so there is no need to reimplement these primitives.

Depending on the mode of operation and the length of the used keys, there exists an upper bound on
 how many messages can be sent securely without changing the key. Therefore, it must be either made sure that this number 
 cannot be achieved in a reasonable time, or some kind of key-renegotiation has to be used, which is the task of the key management algorithm.
 Nevertheless, if a session key and the corresponding traffic gets known to an adversary, all the past data will be disclosed (and all future traffic
 if no new key is used). Protocols like Off The Record Messaging (OTR) \cite{Borisov:2004:OCW:1029179.1029200} avoid this problem by using short term session keys,
 thus providing Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS). This property ensures that, even if a key is known to an adversary, no future and no past messages can be decrypted (beside of
 one single message).
 %Problematic about OTR is its lack of support for multi-party conversations, a feature that is tried to be achieved with
 %Multi Party OTR (mpOTR) \cite{Goldberg:2009:MOM:1653662.1653705,}\cite{Liu:2013:IGO:2517840.2517867}.
% Finally, a critical prerequisite is the used Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG).
% While the used platform contains a hardware based PRNG, is has to be examined if the provided entropy can be considered
% secure, because a predictable PRNG turns all other cryptographic measurements useless.
\\

As stated earlier, KNX defines no methods for securing datagrams in the original proposal - a situation comparable to the origin IPv4 \cite{rfc791} standard:

IPv4, which is until today one of the basic building blocks for worldwide internet communication, suffers a serious limitation because it
does not offer confidentiality and integrity on the network level. The problem was mitigated in 2 ways: one solution was 
the introduction of another layer - TLS -  above the IPv4 layer, responsible for handling security.
The second way was the design of the IPsec \cite{rfc4301} 
extension, which authenticates and encrypts data sent with IPv4 by defining two security services,
namely the Authentication Header (AH) to provide authenticity, and the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) for confidentiality. Internet
Key Exchange (IKE) is used as key negotiating protocol. This way,
IPsec can provide end-to-end encryption and protect the payload of higher level protocols like TCP or UDP.

For KNX, the following extensions exist:

KNX Application Note 157 specifies an optional security layer for KNX networks \cite{knx_data_sec}, comparable to TLS.
KNX Application Note 158 improves security for KNX/IP networks \cite{knx_ip_sec}.
EIBsec uses key servers to provide secure management and group communication and implements a proof of
concept \cite{KraInnosec2013}. Salvatore Cavalieri and Giovanni Cutuli propose another way how to authenticate and encrypt KNX traffic \cite{knxsec}.

\section{Relatedness to Computer Engineering}

Modern cryptography relies heavily on number theory and probabilistic theory and is the basis of this work.
The practical work will be to implement the multi-threaded daemons on the RaspberryPis, written in the low-level programming language
C, by using the C++ API offered by EIBD.
