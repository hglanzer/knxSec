\subsection{KNX addressing scheme}

Care must be taken that no duplicate knx addresses are used within the network. Therefore, the following addressing convention is proposed:
While it would be possible to use the same addresses on booth lines per gateway, a different scheme is used.
For the secured network, the address ranges starting at address 1.1.1 to address 1.1.15 and 1.2.1 to 1.2.15 are reserved for secure line number
1 and 2 respectively, which allows a maximum of 15 gateways. Different addresses are used mainly because it facilitates debugging. Additionally, the used
address ranges can be re-used outside the secured network by standard devices anyway.
On the unsecured lines, every gateway uses an address from the range 1.0.1 - 1.0.15. Addresses are assigned in a linearly ascending way, so gateway number 1
uses addresses 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 for secure lines 1 and 2, and 1.0.1 for its unsecured line.
