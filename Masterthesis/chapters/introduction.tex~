\section{Motivation}

Driven by the need to reduce maintenance costs and to improve usability, the application of \glspl{hbas} is no longer limited to traditional \gls{hvac} services.
Modern building management includes much more different and more sophisticated tasks like elevator control, alarm systems or access control, to name a few.
To reduce costs it would be natural to bring together these services under the control of one management system, a claim also supported through improved 
standardization efforts.
\\
In contrast to traditional \gls{hvac} tasks, where security concerns were neglected, integration of these additional services calls for application of measurements
to prevent misuse of them.
