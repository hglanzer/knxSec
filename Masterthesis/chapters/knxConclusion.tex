\section{Summary}
Examining the security measurements shows up parallels to the \gls{ipv4} world. As with \gls{knx}, no security measurements were foreseen in the
original standard. The problem was
fixed here in two ways: \gls{tls} was added as a sublayer between \gls{osi} layers 4 and 5, allowing application-transparent encryption and authentication, 
similar to KNX Application Note 158, as described above. The second solution was the introduction of \gls{ipsec}, extending \gls{ipv4} and thus enabling authentication and encryption on \gls{ip} level.

Despite the \gls{knx} extensions, no solution providing high availability exists. Therefore, this work proposes a to combination of cryptographic measurements with
redundancy mechanisms, allowing its deployment in more demanding environments.
